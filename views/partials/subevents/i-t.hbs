        <h2 class="ui">Ricardo Hinojosa</h2>
        <p class="ui">
          Ricardo Hinojosa, aka Kamikyodai, is a folding artist who works combining traditional geometric patterns with origami. He has recreationally folded paper for 17 years and professionally taught people to fold for 5 years. His interest in geometry and in what are known as Islamic Patterns led to developing the use the mathematics of origami to construct geometric ideas. We do both simple and complex, decorative and illustrative, traditional and new. The practice is of understanding folding as a tool to solve spatial problems in the form of ornamental and fun objects.
