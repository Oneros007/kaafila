  Come, join us for a free-wheeling candid chat with a legend of the theatre and films as we try and unpack the craft of storytelling in both the mediums and take inspiration from the guestâ€™s extraordinary journey on the stage and cinema. Listen, engage and question ideas that erupt within the dialogue to be moderated by a budding theatre student.
