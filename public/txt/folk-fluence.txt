Theme:
"Freedom"
Whether we are aware of it or not, we express yourself all the time through 'nonverbal communication'. Our facial expressions, our posture, our body language - all of that sends a message about how we are feeling or what we need without the need for words.

Dance gives us this "Freedom" of 'Self-expression & Creative Movement', where we explore the scope of any type of emotional release that reflects a genuine reaction to a situation or event. This can be verbal or nonverbal and can use the body or external media. 

As the theme of this yearâ€™s festival is, 'Freedom', we invite all
performing artistes to use this platform to showcase the different Indian Folk, Classical & Contemporary dance forms and bring forth the fusion of these dances from the different parts of India.
